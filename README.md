**Tailored Maps**

A expo built react native app that allows a user to plot a map, register its position on earth, add locations to be 
reachable and then publish via qr code none of which requires me having any
of their information / a login


**Remember**

- Any es5/6 modules need to be added to package.json/transformIgnorePatterns
